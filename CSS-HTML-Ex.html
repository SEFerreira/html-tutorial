    <h2>As a nurse, you are given the privilege and delicate responsibility of
        caring for the injured, sick and dying. This gives you the opportunity to make
        a difference in the lives of others by giving care to others in their time of
        need, just as you would want someone to do for you if you were in their place.</h2>

    <p> <span class="link-style">Nurses save lives by keeping a constant eye on their patients</span>.
        With their years of health education, nurses know how to assess patients. When nurses notice a deterioration in
        their health, they make a rescue plan. In between all this surveillance and intervention, nurses educate their
        patients.</p>
