    <h2>As a nurse, you are given the privilege and delicate responsibility of
        caring for the injured, sick and dying. This gives you the opportunity to make
        a difference in the lives of others by giving care to others in their time of
        need, just as you would want someone to do for you if you were in their place.</h2>

    <p> <span class="link-style">Nurses save lives by keeping a constant eye on their patients</span>.
        With their years of health education, nurses know how to assess patients. When nurses notice a deterioration in
        their health, they make a rescue plan. In between all this surveillance and intervention, nurses educate their
        patients.</p>

    <p>Few careers offer the same advantages as nursing: registered
        nurses earn high sDalaries, work with interesting people,
        and — perhaps most importantly — significantly affect people’s
        lives, often even saving their lives. With the registered nurse
        workforce projected to grow by 15% over the next decade, the
        nursing industry also must grapple with an intensifying work
        shortage as baby boomers retire. This means that nursing graduates
        usually do not struggle to find jobs once they graduate. Yet nursing
        can work as an ideal career for a plethora of other reasons as well. Read on to learn about;

    <p class="red-text">Nursing is not for everyone. </p>
    <p> You must be prepared to work hard.
